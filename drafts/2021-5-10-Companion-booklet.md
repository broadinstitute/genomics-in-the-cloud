title: Book figures and the semi-official companion booklet 
---

This is the second post in a series that aims to provide insight into what our book is about, and what it's like to work through, to supplement the information provided in the [listing](https://www.amazon.com/Genomics-Cloud-Using-Docker-Terra-ebook-dp-B086Q7D47V/dp/B086Q7D47V). In the inaugural "What's in the can?" post, I recycled a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/VdaGeraldine/status/1263336914859560962?s=20) that summarized the core lesson of each chapter. 

In this post, ... figures and companion booklet ...  

In the next installment, I'll cover reader reviews, since that's also a source of information that a lot of people use when making a purchase decision.
