You can find all the figures in full color the [figures](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/genomics-in-the-cloud/figures/) directory of the GCS bucket.

You may use all figures except 3-3 and 6-15 in your own non-commercial work, preferably with a notice of attribution referring to the book. For commercial use, please contact permissions@oreilly.com. Figures 3-3 and 6-15 do not belong to us, so you must request permission from their respective owners, which are noted in the book.

We also put together a [companion booklet](https://storage.googleapis.com/genomics-in-the-cloud/figures/Genomics_in_the_Cloud___Figures_Booklet.pdf) that contains the figures and their captions for more convenient browsing or printing. It's "semi-official" in the sense that we created and maintain it, but it is not published by O'Reilly, so it does not go through their quality control process. Think of it as an artisanal, locally sourced side dish.
